# Welcome To Tree Streak
Everyday, there’s tons of small changes we can all make to help protect the environment and reduce our ecological impact. However, most people aren’t aware of the kinds of small changes they can make, or even if they are, lack the ability to connect their individual changes to collective impact. With environmental issues and the discussion around climate change so often being dominated by massive, incomprehensible numbers far beyond our everyday scale, it can be easy to believe that your choices don’t make a difference and that there’s not much you individually can do. With this app, our goal is to highlight the differences you and your friends can make, encourage turning these small everyday life adjustments into a habit, educate you on going further, and help make it feel like you’re doing your part in the fight for the planet.
